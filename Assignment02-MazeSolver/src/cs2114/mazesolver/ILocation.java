/**
 * <p>
 * This interface represents an (x, y) coordinate pair, used to indicate
 * cell locations in the maze. Locations should be <strong>immutable</strong>.
 * Immutability means that once you create one you cannot change its
 * coordinates; you can only create new ones with different coordinates.
 * </p><p>
 * Locations do not have references back to a maze; they represent the (x, y)
 * values only.
 * </p><p>
 * You must write a class that implements this interface in your program. In
 * addition to the methods required by this interface, you must also provide:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><p>
 * A two-argument constructor that takes the integer x- and y-coordinates of
 * the location, in that order.
 * </p></li>
 * <li><p>
 * An overridden {@code equals(Object)} method that returns true if the object
 * passed in is also a {@code Location} and has the same x- and y-coordinates
 * as the receiver.
 * </p></li>
 * <li><p>
 * An overridden {@code toString()} method that returns a string representation
 * of the location, formatted like "(x, y)".
 * </p></li>
 * </ul>
