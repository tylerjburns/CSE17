/**
 * <p>
 * This interface represents a maze in your maze solver application. You must
 * write a class that implements this interface to represent the maze using a
 * square 2-dimensional array (same width and height) of {@link MazeCell} values
 * and make it support the operations in this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Your maze class must also provide a constructor that takes a single argument,
 * which represents the size of the maze. All mazes are square, so the size
 * represents the width and the height. For example, a maze of size 5 would have
 * width 5 and height 5, for a total of 25 cells.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a maze is first created, every cell should be set to
 * {@link MazeCell#UNEXPLORED}. Furthermore, its starting point should be at
 * location (0, 0) (the upper-left corner) and its goal should be at (size - 1,
 * size - 1) (the lower-right corner). These can be changed later by calling the
 * {@link #setStartLocation(ILocation)} and {@link #setGoalLocation(ILocation)}
 * methods.
 * </p>
